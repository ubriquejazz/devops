# MANDO A DISTANCIA

## Setting the house code

The remote control incorporates 4 buttons and 4 positions slide-switch that ranges from A to D.
To control the Coati alarm this switch has to be in the "A" position (orange background). Simply follow this orange track for operating in 1(instant alarm), 2(delay alarm), 3(chimie) and 4(disarm) modes.

## Emitting the ID code

In order to communicate with the Coati alarm, it is essential that the same ID code is used between receiver and xmitter. Pressing the "Open Lock" button for 3 seconds will emit the ID code to the Coati alarm.

- If the Coati alarm responds with a long beep, the "code learning" process has finished sucessfully.

- If consecutive short beeps ocurrs, the "code learning" process has failed.
