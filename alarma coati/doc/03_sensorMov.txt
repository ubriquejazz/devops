SENSOR DE MOVIMIENTO

The PIR detector is designed to detect movement in an area by changes of infrared radiation levels caused for example when a person moves within the field of vision (FoV). If movement is detected a radio signal is emitted to the Coati alarm.

2. Setting

- After inserting the batteries, the PIR detector needs a 60 seconds warm-up period before emitting the ID code.
- Set the Coati alarm to the "code learning" mode.
- Press the Sabotage SW for more than 3 seconds. This will emit the ID code to the Coati alarm.
- If the Coati alarm responds with a long beep, the "code learning" process has finished sucessfully.
- If consecutive short beeps ocurrs, the "code learning" process has failed.

3. Operation

- When removing the rear cover the Sabotage SW will be triggered and a radio signal will be emitted to the Coati alarm.
- The Coati alarm will sound 30s and be silent for 10s. Such a cycle will be repeated for 10 times.
- The PIR detector is designed to detect movement within the FoV. If movement is detected a radio signal is emitted to the Coati alarm to activate the chimie or alarm.
- The indication of LED represents the following status:

	LED indication					Status
	--------------					------
	illuminating steadily				PIR detector is emitting radio singal
	Flashing every 30 seconds			Low battery
